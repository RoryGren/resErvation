Index.php

User can specify a range of dates, number of people and a list of rooms is displayed.
When room selected, modal popup allows the user to fill in Name and contact details and confirm booking details.
Clicking button checks for field population, confirms existing user, by name and telephone number, or creates new record and writes reservation to database.

TODO: 
1. Does not check for double bookings
2. Does not check that dates are only in the future.
3. Only does insert and select. No update or delete.
4. Field display order needs to be corrected. (Array indexes were used for ajax data transfer to PHP. Should be changed to use input field id.)
